Title = QSKA: A Quantum Secured Privacy-Preserving Mutual Authentication Scheme for Energy Internet-Based Vehicle-to-Grid Communication

Authors = Kumar Prateek, Soumyadev Maity and Neetesh Saxena

QSKA uses superdense coding with a hash function to exchange the secret keys between EV, UC, and/or CS. The description of the QSKA comprises four phases:
Phase 1: System Initialization {This phase deals with utility center initialization, charging station registration, and electric vehicle registration}.
Phase 2: EV Pre-Authentication {This phase deals with charging station authentication and electric vehicle authentication}.
Phase 3: Pseudo-Identity Generation for Smart Meter {This phase handles pseudo-identity generation and session key generation for electric vehicles}. 
Phase 4: Smart Meter Data Authentication and Verification {This phase handles privacy-preserving authenticated EV charging request reporting}.

Miscellaneous: The QSKA Code (QSKA_Run.py) is provided. Besides, appropriate comments are available in the code started with # for understanding the concepts of the QSKA.
Also, all resources (simulators, python packages and libraries) required installation for successful implementation are already included in the code.
